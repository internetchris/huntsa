<p style="width:750px;font-size:16px">“It took a severe drought in 1993 to break me down and let me surrender my life to God. Being a rancher and a hunter all my life, God’s love was so encompassing that He knew a drought would be the tool to break into my heart. It took me a number of years to understand that my love for the great outdoors and hunting was God given and not my idea! God, in his awesome creativity, put together in HuntSA my two passions - my love for Him and my love for the great outdoors.”<br/><br/>  –Rufus Luttig – owner Hunt SA.  </p>

Each one of us is equipped to make a difference in the lives of someone less fortunate than ourselves. Hunt SA ministries opens up the opportunity for you to reach out. We can take you to the outlying rural areas where most South Africans have not been. Poverty and AIDS/HIV are prevalent and the need is great. This is truly a life changing opportunity!

<p> There are unlimited opportunities to serve God’s Kingdom while in  South Africa. We work in the poverty and AIDS/HIV stricken Transkei region on the Eastern Cape.</p>

<h2><span class="custom_h2">Opportunities</span></h2>
<div id="outreach_opp">
<ul>
  <li>Involvement  in feeding orphans with “Oceans of Mercy” in what we call “Soup clubs”. These clubs serve over 2,000 orphans per day presently with an incredible need for many more.</li>
  <li>We are involved in renovating an old Mission base in Bambisana village and can use your construction skills to see this base completed and usable in the near future.</li>
  <li>Hunt SA hunters have supported the Eastern Cape International Bible training school  since 2006,  raising up a new generation of Christian leaders, mainly from the Xhosa tribe. During the trip, we also visit the bible school, where students  attend  a six month bible course to improve their knowledge of God’s love for them. This equips them to minister to their own people.</li>
  <li>We can provide  custom made outreach  to accommodate your schedule while in South Africa  if you desire,which includes visiting hospitals and schools and encouraging the missionaries that work there full-time.  As you see the heartbreaking need, God will show you how He wants you to be involved.</li>
  <li>We also visit the local people in their traditional homes. A six-day outreach comprises five nights of camping with one night of luxury accommodation at a cost of $180 a day. Alternatively six nights of luxury accommodation is available at extra cost.  </li>
